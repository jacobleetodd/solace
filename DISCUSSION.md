- The top level `page` component is client component. This is necessary to use React hooks but defeats many of the purposes of using Next.js. At the very least, we should inject the initial data load on the server and move any component that require hooks down the tree. This would also eliminate the `useEffect` hook since the `page` will not load until the data has been fetched.
- This project is using TypeScript but the data and handler functions are not typed. This makes the developer experience worse and increases the likelihood of runtime errors from code such as `advocate.specialties.map` or `advocate.yearsOfExperience.includes(searchTerm)`.
- The code is rendering DOM elements in within a map function without providing a key for each rendered child. This causes problems for the React reconciliation process since, without unique keys, all children will appear to be the same element type.
- Searching is being handled client side which mean only the records returned from the original fetch will be included in the search results. Searching is typically handled by the server to ensure all results are returned and to properly handle pagination and sorting. The searching function is also case sensitive and users typically expect searching to be case insensitive. Finally, the search function is directly manipulating the search term label DOM. It is fine to use uncontrolled components in React but this is usually done with the help of form libraries such as `react-hook-form` or `tanstack-forms`. The more common solution is to make components controlled using React state which allows DOM updates within the React lifecycle and reconciliation process.
- There is no error handling for the API response. In addition, there is no zero or loading states for the table. Error and loading states can be handled in Next.js using `app/error` and `app/loading` components.
- It is a little strange to have state for both `advocates` and `filteredAdvocates` since `filteredAdvocates` is a subset of `advocates`. Neither of these states is necessary when using Next.js but at the very least we can eliminate `filteredAdvocates` state in favor of something like`getFilteredAdvocates(advocates)`.
- `<br />` tags are being used for spacing DOM elements. This is typically done using CSS solutions like margin / padding / flex / grid.
- Installing and using Material UI since this provides both styling and a component library and I am very familiar with it.
